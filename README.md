# DSA Snippets Repository

Welcome to my personal collection of essential Data Structures & Algorithms snippets, designed for quick reference and competitive programming.  
This repo is continuously updated as I learn and master new algorithms.

## Folder Structure (In Progress)

| Folder        | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Templates/`  | Input/output snippets, fast I/O setups, STL tricks |
| `Sorting/`    | Sorting algorithms: bubble, quick, merge, STL sort etc. |
| `Arrays/`     | Common array operations: reverse, rotate, prefix sum |
| `Strings/`    | String manipulation, palindrome, anagram checks, STL |

## Pro Tip

Keep this open as your second brain during contests.  
No need to write binary search or merge sort from scratch ever again!
